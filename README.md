Currently we are using the aos exported from the github

If you want to know how the animate on scroll works using javascipt 
dom manipulation, then uncomment  the following in the files
1. uncomment animation.css in index.html
2. uncomment animation.js in index.html


Add the classes from the following in the section, span or div elements
you want to add animation to. The classes are:
1. hidden-fadeIn
2. hidden-fadeInUp
3. hidden-zoomIn
4. hidden-slideInLeft
5. hidden-slideInRight

These classes are then changed after the page loads in the browser
The animation.js files change the class with respect to the animation.css.
